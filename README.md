Web-Thang
=========

Web-Thang is a chrome extension that replaces all instances of the term 'web app' or 'website/web site' with the term 'web thang'.

Based heavily on this [cloud-to-butt extension](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt)
and at the behest of [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/journal/6246/)
